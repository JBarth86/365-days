Day 2 - March 24, 2023

Today I finished up a Codewars exercise from yesterday (see ../3-23-2023-day-1/) and then I spent the rest of my code time getting this all organized to put on github and writing the notes, as I'm doing right now, obviously.

I also had several job interviews today, not development jobs, inventory/warehouse jobs. I started the week with no job, now I've got three jobs I'm supposed to start Monday lol. Much like The Highlander, there can be only one! The new job will keep the bills paid for now. Now I can focus on working towards my first job as a developer.

Also been kicking around some ideas for the visual design for my soon to be created personal site, which is unusual for me because visual design is not really my forte. In my head it looks good, we'll see if I can translate that to reality.

There is no code to put in todays folder, but I did in fact finish up code from day one and also getting all this set up on github counts, so day 2 is in the books.

Hell yes.
