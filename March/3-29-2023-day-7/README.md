# Day 7 - March 29, 2023

It's Wednesday, I'm super tired again. I've been tapping at a couple challenges for a bit now but I haven't been able to get either of them working forrectly and I need to get to bed so I'm not miserable at work tomorrow. I did, however, write code today; it just hasn't been committed to this repo yet.

One week of code in the books, 51 more to go.

Shine on you crazy diamonds.
