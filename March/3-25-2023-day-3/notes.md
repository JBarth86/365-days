# Day 3

It's Saturday. I slept in and it was kind of nice but also not the most productive thing I've ever done. Link and spec for Codewars challenge I did today. I was already familiar with regex but I did have to spend a little time researching lookaheads but this solution ultimately came along pretty easily. I continue to remember past coding project ideas so I don't suppose I'll be running out of stuff to work on any time soon.

You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

At least six characters long
contains a lowercase letter
contains an uppercase letter
contains a digit
only contains alphanumeric characters (note that '\_' is not alphanumeric)
