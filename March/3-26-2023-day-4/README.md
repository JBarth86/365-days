# Day 4 - March 26, 2023

It's Sunday. I opened the first Codewars challenge of the day probably about a month ago and just never got started on it. It took me about a minute to complete. I'll probably end up doing more today, if so the details will be included below

### [Moving Zeros To The End](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52597aa56021e91c93000cb0)

**5 kyu**

> Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.
>
> ```python
> move_zeros([1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # returns [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0]
> ```

I felt like the easiest way to tackle this was just to iterate over the numbers and put the 0s in one array and tt he other numbers in another in the same order. Then all I had to do is join the two arrays and return that.

### I brushed up on my markdown game!

Can you tell?

I've updated all the READMEs from the previous days just to clean it up a bit and keep everything uniform
