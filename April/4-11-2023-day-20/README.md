# Day 20 - April 11, 2023

So I had some issues with my backup last night. I had done a few react projects back during the Covid lockdown in 2020. I actually got really good with the whole MERN stack at the time.

Anyhow, turns out react projects:

1. Have a ton of dependencies.

2. this means they have a large number of files associated with them.

3. and therfore take up a ton of space and take forever to transfer to usb.

So, after the transfer ran all night and wasn't even close to completed, I realized that I needed to compress the whole React project folder.

This solved that problem, now I'm just having to catch up on 3 years or so of OS upgrades.

No actual code for now since I'm tied up in upgrades, but I feel like this counts towards my goal.
