# Day 17 - April 8, 2023

Happy Easter!

Continuing slowly through the react course. Dealing with my distro being extremely out of date. I'll have to fix this in the next couple of days so I can work with the most up to date versions of node.js, npm, etc.

I suppose I'll be working on backing up my files tomorrow so I can get started on that.
