# Day 23 - April 14, 2023

It's a busy day, I worked a full shift and my son and I have a 4 hour drive back to Alabama to see the family, so I'm not going to accomplish a ton in terms of code today. I did go into my little react project and made a small change in one of the components just to remember how to pass and use props, nothing major. I'll probably end up watching some javascript refresher videos tonight before bed just to brush up on the syntax.
