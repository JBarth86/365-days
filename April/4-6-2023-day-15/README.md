# Day 15 - April 6, 2023

Alright, it's been a long day, but I still managed to get my "hello world" running in my local environment. I had forgotten about those damned crossorigin errors.

Anyhow that's about all the actual coding I'm going to do today. I am, however, going to continue to watching the 11-hour-long lecture video tonight before bed and I'll follow up with more code tomorrow after work.

I plan to have a productive weekend code-wise as well.

**_Good night, world!_**
