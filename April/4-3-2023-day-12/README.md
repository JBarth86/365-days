# Day 12 - April 3, 2023

So I don't have anything to post again today. I was working on a challenge and was passing most of the test when I realized that I also needed to handle invalid input.

All for the best because my code was starting to look a little unkempt. I'll get it looking a bit cleaner and passing all the tests when I get home from work tomorrow.

Until then...
