# Day 25 - April 16, 2023

So my son and I went to Alabama for the weekend to spend time with the family.

See, I'm currently living just outside of Nashville in a city called Murfreesboro, Tennessee, But I'm a transplant, I have no family here aside from a long time friend, Adam, whom I consider my brother, and his wife and kids.

All that to say, I did a lot of driving this weekend and spent as much time as possible with my family, who I don't see nearly as much as I'd like these days.

Still, I at the very least kept up with the react course I'm currently following along with, and a quick refresher on some javascript syntax.

I'm moving slower than I'd like right now but slow progress is better than no progress. And I **_am not_** falling back into tutorial hell, but I do need to be reminded of some of the stuff I've forgotten.

I'll try to catch up a bit on writing actual code tomorrow, but I'm not upset at my lack of progress this weekend, I needed to spend time with my people and I still made a point to fit in some code related content.
