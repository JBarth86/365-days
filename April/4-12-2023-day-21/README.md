# Day 21 - April 12, 2023

After much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth, I've finally completed a very long overdue update of my operating system.

All my software is completely up to date and I now have a proper React development environment set up again.

I had forgotten how much I really love React's approach to development. Now that I've got everything properly set up I think I'll be in pretty good form in no time.
