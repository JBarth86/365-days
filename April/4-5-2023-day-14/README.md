# Day 14 - April 5, 2023

My soon-to-be 8 year old had his first introduction to the "Hello World" program today!

It took some smooth talking to grab his attention, but once I had his mindset prepped he seemed pretty pumped to see how something as simple as just printing some words to the console works.

The trick is explaining that this is the foundation that Youtube and video games are built on.

Anyhow, this all came about because I was bruhing up on my React skills by watching and coding along with a course from FreeCodeCamp.

There is now a [React sandbox](../../React-sandbox/) in the root directory of this repo where I'll be toying around with some things that count towards my 365 days, but don't necessitate their own repo.
