# Day 19 - April 10, 2023

I almost gave myself a heart attack while backing up files in preperation for the coming os update. I thought I had inadvertently deleted a large chunk of files that I had intended to back up.

I'll spare the details but turns out the files were fine but it took much longer than it should have for me to catch on to what had happened.

The files will take a few hours to transfer so I won't be able to update my system until tomorrow at least.
