# 365-days

This repo will be used to track my journey through 365 days of code.

As of March 23, 2023 I am committed to creating at least 1 line of code, 1 function, 1 class, 1 something.

To get started I'll be working on finishing up a personal website I started building with React during quarantine. I'll also be positing solutions to programming challenges I'll be completing on codewars and possibly some other platforms. I will also be journaling the whole process, first here in the repo, and then on my website once I've gotten it up and running.

Hopefully at the end of all this I will have added more skills to my repertoire, recovered some of the skills I've picked up and subsequently lost over the years, and maybe even finally landed my dream job as a software developer.

Speaking of which, I am very much open to job offers so if you like what you see, feel free to shoot me an email at jbarth1986@gmail.com
